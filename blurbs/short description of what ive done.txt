In my role as Senior Programmer Analyst for the HON Company, I was in charge of designing the architecture of new functionality on the HON Company website (which sees over 2 million users a year) and deploying said functionality to our development, quality assurance (QA), and then production environments. I designed and developed several applications and tools as a part of the site such as our Product Configurator React application, CSV Product Content Importer, and SKU Data Exploder. I also configured and built a Continuous Delivery pipeline for our new site with TeamCity, Octopus, Docker, and Bash scripting. I started as a developer and worked my way into application architecture design, DevOps engineering, systems administration, and management of Agile processes for our development teams.
