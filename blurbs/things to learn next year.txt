Node.js
I've built REST APIs with Express in Node.js for personal projects, but I am curious about how large-scale projects use Node.js to create microservices. I hope to learn more about this in my career and through personal research.

C++
After learning C++ in college I haven't had the opportunity to use C++ in a professional context. I want to know how to write C++ with the goal of making the complex parts of a system more resource efficient and faster. To accomplish this I have plans to work on a personal project that will map out every possible decision path of the game Mancala in order to create the perfect opponent AI.

WebAssembly
This technology is incredibly interesting and provides an innovative and performant way to create novel user experiences that would differentiate a site from its competitors. Learning WebAssembly should be very accessible with online resources and the availability of tools like AssemblyScript that compiles TypeScript to WebAssembly.

Search Engine Optimization
I want to use as many SEO tools on my personal blog as possible in order to drive traffic. I have a wealth of online resources and fellow site administrator friends that I will draw upon for ideas and advice.
